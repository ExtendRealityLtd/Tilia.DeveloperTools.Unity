# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2021-01-04)

#### Features

* **Event:** add UnityEvent Source Tracer editor window ([a0db68b](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.DeveloperTools.Unity/commit/a0db68b5a56c357cd37820611108041825bc2999))
  > The UnityEventSourceTracer editor window allows for the tracing of any UnityEvent that is affecting a component. The window works by caching all UnityEvent listeners and then when a component is selected, the tracer will reverse look up any UnityEvent listeners that are affecting the selected component.
  > 
  > The relevant docs and initial readmes have also been added too.
